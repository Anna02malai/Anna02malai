Welcome! I’m Annamalai M.

I am a graduate student in the <a href="https://me.udel.edu/academics/graduate/msr/" style="text-decoration: none;"> M.Sc. Robotics program </a> (Class of 2025) at the <a href="https://www.udel.edu/" style="text-decoration: none;"> University of Delaware </a>, where I focused on precision agriculture robots. The cornerstone of my program was an independent study capstone project under <a href="https://me.udel.edu/faculty/yin-bao/" style="text-decoration: none;"> Prof. Yin Bao </a> in the Digital Agriculture Lab. I worked with the Rivulet 2.0 robot, implementing SLAM-based localization and navigation on a gantry system (center-pivot irrigation).

I led and represented the University of Delaware’s team in the <a href="https://www.farmroboticschallenge.ai/" style="text-decoration: none;"> Farm Robotics Challenge 2025 </a> and won the <a href="https://www.farmroboticschallenge.ai/2025results/v/universitydelaware"> Judge's Choice Impact Award </a>, where I worked on autonomous navigation for the Farm-ng Amiga robot. I also had the opportunity to intern remotely with TRIC Robotics, advised by <a href="https://me.udel.edu/faculty/herbert-tanner/" style="text-decoration: none;"> Prof. Herbert Tanner </a> (CARS Lab), where I tackled an NP-hard path planning problem for the company’s robot in constrained agricultural fields.

Through my work, I aim to advance robotic capabilities in unstructured environments, focusing on motion planning, path planning, and optimization.

I hold a Bachelor's degree in Mechatronics Engineering (with Distinction) from <a href = "https://tce.edu/academics/departments/mechatronics" style="text-decoration: none;"> Thiagarajar College of Engineering </a>, class of 2021. During my undergraduate studies, I had the privilege of working under exceptional mentors.
