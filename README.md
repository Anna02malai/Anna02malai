Welcome! I am Annamalai M.

I am a graduate student from the <a href="https://www.udel.edu/" style="text-decoration: none;">  University of Delaware (UD) </a>, where I worked on precision Agriculture robots. I was in the <a href="https://me.udel.edu/academics/graduate/msr/" style="text-decoration: none;"> M.Sc. Robotics program </a>, Batch of 2025. My program's cornerstone was the Independent study capstone projects, which I was fortunate to have it with <a href="https://me.udel.edu/faculty/yin-bao/" style="text-decoration: none;"> Prof. Yin Bao, Digital Ag lab</a>. I used the Rivulet 2.0 robot to localize and map the environment using SLAM and navigate on the gantry system (Centre-pivot Irrigation System). I led and represented the University of Delaware's team in <a href="https://www.farmroboticschallenge.ai/" style="text-decoration: none;"> Farm Robotics Challenge 2025</a> where  i worked on Autonomous Navigation of the Farm_ng Amiga robot. I also had a oppurtunity to do a remote internship with the TRIC robotics company with href="https://me.udel.edu/faculty/herbert-tanner/" style="text-decoration: none;"> Prof. Herbert Tanner, Cooperative Robotics Lab as my advisor. I worked on a NP-hard problem to path plan for the company's robot for the given constrained agriculture field. Through my lifeâ€™s work, I want to advance robotic capabilities in unstructured environments with three focuses: motion planning, path planning and optimization.

I graduated from Thiagarajar College of Engg in 2021, attaining a Bachelor's (with Distinction) in Mechatronics Engineering. During my undergraduate, I was fortunate to work under the guidance of wonderful mentors.
